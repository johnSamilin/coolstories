This is\n        complete new exeprience for me, and perhaps game developer guys will\n        find this text amateurish, but it was fun for me to dig into WebAssembly\n        and A* algorithm.\n      </p>\n      <h2>A*</h2>\n      <p>\n        If you imagine that The Surface as a grid, then all you're gonna do to{\" \"}\n        <em>find tha way</em> is to search the in graph.

Some cells\n        (the ones with trees) are impassable at all. The goal is to find the\n        fastest path.

The thing is (and it\n        mentioned in the article) that Wasm that is compiled from Go behaves as\n        a program rather than a library, so there's possibility to use state in\n        it and not to initialize grid with obstacles every time you want to use\n        it. Keeping in mind that in this particular WebGL scene wasm module will\n        be invoked on mouse move event, this may save some resources. On the\n        other hand, this could possibly be a problem:\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            if a module throws an exception, then the thing that won't let Go\n            script end closes itself and thus subsequent calls will be\n            impossible;\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Go doesn't export any functions, instead it registers them in global\n            scope;\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            it can use global scope to modify DOM, which frightens me a bit.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <Link to=\"https://github.com/johnSamilin/go-pathfinding\">Go</Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Performance profile</strong>\n        <ProfileImgPathfindingGo />\n      </p>\n      <h2>More!</h2>\n      <p>\n        Since I went so far, why not to implement A* myself using AssembyScript?\n        I'm very excited about it's possibilities.

Map.keys() returns an array and not an iterator). By the way, it's\n        always possible to convert AssembyScript to regular TypeScript pretty\n        easy.{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"https://github.com/johnSamilin/assemblyscript-pathfinding\">\n          Result\n        </Link>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Performance profile</strong>\n        <ProfileImgPathfindingAs />\n      </p>\n      <h2>What to do with all this?</h2>\n      <p>\n        I hoped that a simple migration from browser level to WebAssembly gives\n        me performance boost. But as you may see from performance profiler\n        sceenshots, there's no much difference. Sometimes Wasm works even worse\n        when you move the pointer to fast or move the camera around the scene.\n        FPS may be 1-2. In the end, I'd prefer JS version because it's simpler,\n        more stable and more convenient.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Update</h3>\n      <p>\n        Simple{\" \"}\n        <Link to=\"https://github.com/johnSamilin/assemblyscript-pathfinding/pull/1\">\n          build optimizations\n        </Link>{\" \"}\n        may speed up WebAssembly version up to 4 times. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n      </p>\n      <h3>P.S.</h3>\n      <p>\n        <br />\n        Yeah, I know that he doesn't go anywhere.
